        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Here at 'Burke's Pizza' we're about getting piping hot pizza to your tables how YOU want it. With quality and quickness, you won't be able to put our food back down after you take your first bite!! That brick oven pizza is unlike any of the fast food pizza you've had before. We became so good at making pizza we thought, "Could we make other food taste this great?"; spoiler alert‚Ä¶ WE CAN!! To accompany our pizza we have delicious options of wings, salads, and desserts. Having difficulty believing us?? Check out what these people said:</p>

        <p>‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Susanne Miller: As somebody who has been watching their weight I initially didn't want to go to Burke's Pizza. My husband and his work buddies went there last week, and apparently it was the best pizza he's ever had. So he BEGGED that we took the whole family there. I caved in‚Ä¶ And lucky for me, Burke's Pizza carries salads. Now usually with any other pizza shops their salads are not great, terrible even, but it's not the focus of a pizza shop so you have to understand that their salads won't be great. This is not the case with Burke's Pizza. I did NOT expect that a salad could ever be that good. It's safe to say that we will definitely be coming back (Maybe even just me, but don't tell my husband!!). üòÇüòÇüòÇ</p>
        <p>‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Sam Clark: I am extremely lactose intolerant but I also really enjoy pizza (very inconvenient ik), and usually every time I ask for no cheese at a pizza place they are always so judgemental and/or say that it isn't an option. Big shoutout to Mike at Burke's Pizza who was super understanding of my situation. He deep cleaned the oven before putting my cheese-less buffalo chicken pizza in there. Finally I can enjoy one of my favorite foods in a way that is tailored for me, thanks guys!!</p>
	<p>‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Jonathon Smith: I ordered pizza from these guys thinking, yeah I‚Äôll support my local pizza shop, with Burke‚Äôs Pizza being super inexpensive I wasn‚Äôt expecting much. My pizza arrived at my door in 10 minutes‚Ä¶ I ordered it an hour ahead of the football game expecting it to take an hour. It was so good we ended up having no pizza for the game as we finished the pizza before the game even started. üòÇüòÇüòÇ For real you guys have to try this stuff!!</p>
